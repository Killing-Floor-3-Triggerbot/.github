## **Triggerbot vs Aimbot**

While **aimbots** actively move your crosshair toward a target, a **triggerbot** lets *you* aim naturally—then fires the weapon when the shot lines up. This means you keep **full control of movement and aim**, making it look more natural to both friends and enemies.

In **Killing Floor 3**, that difference matters. The frantic pace often means you’re already on target—triggerbot simply **cuts out the reaction lag** so you can focus on dodging and positioning while still hitting every shot.
